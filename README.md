# ex-Nihilo

**ex-Nihilo** is a technical demonstration for creating new UI ex-Nihilo in an application as the need arises, using AI to generate interface components on the fly that minimize the energy necessary either to convey information to a user or to get information from the user for storage in the data store.

It has a **Python3 / FastAPI** backend and a **TypeScript / NextJS** frontend.

In the server directory run 

```
